# sms_gx — GX/GD for the PC port

`sms_gx` is a static library that implements the Dolphin SDK graphics API the game uses (GX and GD, as declared by `decomp/libs/dolphin/include/dolphin/gx*.h` and `gd*.h`) on top of OpenGL 3.3 core.
It opens its own SDL2 window, or an offscreen EGL context when there is no display.

## Why not aurora

Step 1 of the brief looked at encounter's `aurora`, the GX/VI/PAD layer used by Metaforce.
Its MIT license is compatible, but it was a poor fit here:

- Its renderer is WebGPU through Dawn.
  Prebuilt Dawn packages exist only for 64-bit targets (`linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, ...), and building Dawn from source with two compile jobs on a shared machine takes hours.
  The port builds 32-bit first.
- It needs SDL3 (this machine has SDL2), C++20, and fetches abseil, xxhash and more at configure time.
- It ships its own `dolphin/*` headers and object layouts, which would have to be reconciled with the decomp's headers.

So Step 2 was implemented instead: a compact GX-over-OpenGL backend, about 4,700 lines of code.
No Dolphin-emulator code and no SDK source was used.
Register layouts were cross-checked against the decompiled SDK in `decomp/libs/dolphin/src/gx`, and the public headers in `decomp/libs/dolphin/include/dolphin` define the API.

## Design

The hardware is driven only by register writes and draw commands:

- BP registers (the pixel pipeline: TEV, blending, textures, copies)
- CP registers (the vertex loader: vertex descriptors, attribute formats, arrays)
- XF registers and XF memory (the transform unit: matrices, texgen, lighting, viewport, projection)

`sms_gx` models exactly that.
Every GX API call is encoded into the same register writes the SDK would send (`src/gx_api.cpp`).
Bytes written through the write-gather pipe, and display lists built by GD or J3D, go through one command-stream parser (`src/gx_fifo.cpp`).
The renderer reads its state only from that register file, so API calls, GD display lists and raw FIFO writes (`MarioUtil/PacketUtil.cpp`) always agree.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/gx_api.cpp` | GX API: register encoding, texture/TLUT/light objects, getters, FIFO objects, perf/verify stubs, helper shapes |
| `src/gx_fifo.cpp` | Register file, the BP/CP/XF command parser, the vertex loader (direct, index8 and index16 attributes, every component type and fraction), the write-gather pipe, and the physical-address window |
| `src/gx_shader.cpp` | Generates GLSL from the register state. The vertex shader covers position/normal matrices, the GX projection and viewport, texgen (regular, post-transform/dual-tex, colour, approximate emboss) and lighting (8 lights, diffuse/spot/specular attenuation). The fragment shader covers up to 16 TEV stages in integer math, swap tables, konst selection, compare modes, 4 indirect stages, alpha compare and fog. Programs are cached by the state bytes that shape the code. |
| `src/gx_texture.cpp` | Decoders for I4, I8, IA4, IA8, RGB565, RGB5A3, RGBA8, CMPR, C4, C8 and C14X2 with IA8/RGB565/RGB5A3 TLUTs. The GL texture cache is keyed by address, format, size, mip levels and TLUT, and content hashes are re-checked after an invalidate. |
| `src/gx_render.cpp` | EFB as an FBO (640×528 × scale). Batches primitives (quads, strips and fans become triangle lists). Maps blend, logic-op, depth, cull, scissor, colour/alpha-update and dst-alpha state. Handles EFB copies (display copies become XFB textures; texture copies go through a format-converting pass that includes intensity/YUV, R/G/B/A/RG/GB and Z formats), XFB presentation and EFB peeks. |
| `src/gx_platform.cpp` | Creates the SDL2 window or headless EGL context, presents on `GXCopyDisp`, pumps events and handles the command-line and environment switches |
| `src/gx_vert.cpp` | `GXPosition3f32` and the other vertex writers as real functions |
| `src/gl_loader.cpp` | Loads the GL 3.3 entry points through the host's get-proc function, so nothing links against libGL |
| decomp `libs/dolphin/src/gd/*.c` | GD, compiled unchanged from the decompiled SDK with `src/gd_host_prefix.h` force-included |

## Integration (for the bring-up lead)

1. **Build.**
   The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` already does `add_subdirectory(platform/gx)` with `-DSMS_WITH_GX=ON` and links `sms_gx` whole-archive, so its strong `GX*`/`GD*` definitions replace the weak stubs.
   `sms_gx` links SDL2 and EGL publicly when they are found.
2. **Vertex writers.**
   On the GameCube, `GXVert.h` defines `GXPosition3f32` and the other writers as inlines that store to `0xCC008000`.
   In the port those stores would crash.
   Add the override directory ahead of the decomp headers for the game sources:
   ```cmake
   target_include_directories(sms_game BEFORE PRIVATE ${SMS_GX_OVERRIDE_INCLUDE_DIR})
   ```
   `port_include/dolphin/gx/GXVert.h` then declares the writers as functions that `sms_gx` implements.
   In C++ it also maps `GXWGFifo` onto `GXPC_WGPipe`, a proxy object, so `GXWGFifo.u8 = 0x61;` in `PacketUtil.cpp` feeds the same command parser.
3. **Addresses.**
   Command streams carry 32-bit physical addresses: J3D material display lists (texture images), `GDSetArray`, TLUT loads and display-list calls.
   `sms_gx` maps them as `ptr = 0x80000000 + phys`.
   That matches the unmodified `OSCachedToPhysical` macro and a MEM1 arena mapped at `0x80000000`, which is what `platform/os` does.
   If MEM1 moves, call `GXPC_SetMemoryWindow(base, size)` and keep `OSCachedToPhysical` consistent with it.
   API calls (`GXInitTexObj`, `GXSetArray`, `GXCopyTex`, `GXCopyDisp`, `GXInitTlutObj`) keep full host pointers, so they also work for memory outside the window and on 64-bit hosts.
4. **Caches.**
   Have `DCFlushRange`/`DCStoreRange` call `GXPC_InvalidateRange(p, n)`.
   `GXInvalidateTexAll` also re-checks every cached texture's contents, so textures the CPU rewrites get re-decoded.
5. **Byte order.**
   Display lists, pipe data, textures and TLUTs are read big-endian, as they sit on disc.
   Vertex and matrix arrays default to host order.
   The resource loader should register every file it loads in place with `GXPC_AddBigEndianRange(buf, size)`.
   BMD/BDL vertex arrays inside a registered range are then read big-endian automatically.
   `GXPC_SetArrayBigEndian(attr, 1)` is also available per attribute.
6. **Window and present.**
   No code change is needed.
   `GXInit` calls `GXPC_InitAuto(1)`: an SDL2 window with a GL 3.3 core context opens when `DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set, otherwise the library falls back to headless EGL.
   Every `GXCopyDisp` draws the XFB into the window, letterboxed to 4:3, swaps, and pumps events.
   If VI should own presentation, call `GXPC_SetAutoPresent(0)` and then `GXPC_Present(xfb)` on retrace.
   - Command line: `GXPC_ParseArgs(&argc, argv)` strips `--headless`, `--window` and `--vsync`.
   - Environment: `SMS_HEADLESS=1`, `SMS_GX_SCALE=n` (internal resolution), `SMS_WINDOW_SCALE=n`, `SMS_VSYNC=1`.
   - Windows start centered on the pointer's monitor, with a default size of up to 1280×720. The window and its borders fit within 80% of the usable desktop, leaving its title bar and resize edges accessible. Internal resolution does not enlarge the window; `SMS_WINDOW_SCALE` requests a different starting size, still fitted to the screen.
   - Frame dumps: `SMS_GX_DUMP_EVERY=n SMS_GX_DUMP_DIR=dir` writes every n-th XFB as a PPM, which is useful for headless bring-up.
   - If no display or GPU driver works, run with `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`.
7. **Input.**
   The PAD layer registers `sms_gx_set_event_callback(void (*)(const SDL_Event*))` and may call `sms_gx_pump_events()` from `PADRead`.
   Events are also pumped after every present.
   Game controllers are opened as they are plugged in, and closing the window exits the process.
8. **Threads.**
   All GX calls must come from the thread that ran `GXInit`, which owns the GL context.

## Debugging aids

- `SMS_GX_TRACE_FRAME=n` (or `a-b`) writes every draw of display frame n (the draws after the n-th `GXCopyDisp`) to `$SMS_GX_DUMP_DIR/gx_trace_frame<n>.txt`, or to `$SMS_GX_TRACE_FILE` for a single frame.
  Each draw lists primitive and vertex counts, projection/viewport/scissor, z/blend/alpha-compare/fog state, lighting channels and the lights they use, texgens, every TEV stage decoded (`PREV = (ZERO + lerp(ZERO,TEXC,RASC))*1 clamp`), TEV/konst registers, swap tables, bound texture maps (address, format, size, wrap/filter/LOD, TLUT, whether it is an EFB copy) and the first vertices.
  EFB copies and `GXPeekZ` calls appear in order.
- `SMS_GX_TRACE_BT=1` adds to each traced draw the host call stack of its last `GXBegin`, and logs every projection load with its caller (`module(+offset)`; resolve with `addr2line -f -C -e build/linux-32/sms`).
- `SMS_GX_TRACE_PROBE=x,y;x,y` adds, after each traced draw, the EFB colour/alpha and depth at those points, which finds the draw that breaks a pixel.
- `SMS_GX_DUMP_EVERY=n` writes every n-th XFB as a PPM (see above).
- `SMS_GX_DUMP_SHADERS=dir` writes every generated program as `dir/prog<id>.vs/.fs`; traces name the program each draw used.
- `SMS_GX_STATS=n` logs, every n display frames, draws/vertices per frame, shader compiles, texture uploads, the milliseconds per frame spent in sms_gx (split into textures, batches, EFB copies, peeks and GPU waits), how many reads per frame made the CPU wait for the GPU, GL calls per frame (in total and for the most-called entry points), batch flushes, texture bytes hashed, vertex-loader time and idle time.
  Without it (and with the overlay closed) only the overall sms_gx time is measured; the other timers read the clock per primitive and per texture bind.
- `GXPC_GetTimes` gives the same breakdown as totals for the overlay; see `gx_pc.h`.
  On this machine the 32-bit build renders with Mesa llvmpipe (no 32-bit NVIDIA GL is installed), so GPU work shows up as CPU time at the first sync point, usually the EFB copy.

## Coverage against `api-surface.tsv`

All **181** GX (149) and GD (32) functions the game, JSystem and THPPlayer call are provided.
Eleven of them are header inlines or macros that work unchanged: the `GDBegin`, `GDEnd` and `GDSetCurrent` family, `GDOverflowCheck`, `GXEnd`, `GXSetTexCoordGen` and `GXInitLightShininess`.
`libsms_gx.a` defines 349 `GX*`/`GD*` symbols in total, which is the whole public SDK surface.

Of the 181 used functions, about **157 are fully implemented**.
The following are accepted, and their state is stored, but they have no or only partial rendering effect:

| Function | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `GXSetMisc` | no-op |
| `GXEnableBreakPt`, `GXDisableBreakPt` | no-op |
| `GXPokeAlphaRead` | no-op |
| `GXSetDither` | dithering is not emulated |
| `GXSetCopyFilter`, `GXSetDispCopyGamma` | stored, not applied to the XFB |
| `GXSetDispCopyFrame2Field`, `GXSetFieldMode` | no interlacing |
| `GXSetDispCopyYScale` | returns the line count; the XFB keeps the EFB height |
| `GXSetCoPlanar` | no-op |
| `GXInvalidateVtxCache` | no-op |
| `GXInitTexCacheRegion` | bookkeeping only; textures are read from RAM |
| `GXSetZTexture` | not rendered |
| `GXSetFogRangeAdj` | registers written; range adjustment not rendered |
| `GXSetLineWidth` | lines are 1 px, because core GL has no wide lines |
| `GXEnableTexOffsets`, `GXSetTexCoordCylWrap` | not rendered |
| `GXPixModeSync`, `GXSetDrawDone`, `GXWaitDrawDone`, `GXDrawDone` | the pipeline is synchronous; callbacks fire immediately |
| `GXGetCPUFifo`, `GXGetFifoPtrs` | report a static FIFO object |

## Tests

`build/gx_selftest` (CTest `gx_selftest`, run offscreen) passes 25/25 checks on both this machine's NVIDIA EGL device and Mesa llvmpipe:

- copy-clear, and a vertex-colour quad through `PASSCLR`
- a textured RGBA8 quad through a **2-stage TEV** (texture × rasterized colour, then × konst colour): exact 8-bit results
- an **EFB → texture copy** (RGBA8, and I8 through the luma conversion) sampled back
- alpha blending, alpha compare, subtractive blending and scissor
- a **GD-built display list** (decomp `GDSetCullMode`/`GDSetZMode`, raw BP writes and a draw command) through `GXCallDisplayList`
- raw write-gather-pipe BP writes via `GXPC_WGPipe`
- perspective projection with depth test, a lit channel (diffuse light, ambient × material) and `GXPeekZ`
- a display copy read back from the XFB
- CPU decoders for I4, RGB5A3, CMPR, and C8 with an RGB565 TLUT

```sh
cmake -S platform/gx -B platform/gx/build && make -C platform/gx/build -j2
platform/gx/build/gx_selftest               # offscreen
platform/gx/build/gx_selftest --window f.ppm   # shows the frame; dumps the EFB
```

The library also builds with `-m32`.
The 32-bit build needs the i386 SDL2 and EGL development packages for the window and headless paths.
Without them it still compiles, but only a host-supplied context (`GXPC_Init(getProc, scale)`) is available.

## Known gaps

- **Not verified against the game yet.**
  Nothing here has drawn a J2D screen from the real game, and the 3D paths (J3D display lists, skinning, indirect effects) are untested beyond the self-test.
- **Indirect texturing is approximate.**
  Offsets are computed in texel units with the static matrices.
  Dynamic S/T matrices (bump mapping) and the exact hardware fixed-point rounding are missing.
  Emboss texgen passes the source coordinate through.
- **Early-Z.**
  With `GXSetZCompLoc(GX_TRUE)` and alpha test, the hardware writes depth for pixels that fail the alpha test; GL does not.
- **EFB copies are also written back to RAM.**
  Every texture copy is read back and stored in its GX tile layout (the GL copy stays as the sampling fast path), because the game reads some on the CPU: Delfino's goop map (`TPollutionLayer::isPolluted`) is updated only by EFB copies. A `DCFlushRange`/`DCStoreRange` over a copy drops the GL copy so RAM wins again. `SMS_GX_COPY_WRITEBACK=0` turns write-back off; `SMS_GX_COPY_LOG=n` logs the first n write-backs.
- **Pixel metrics** (`GXClearPixMetric`/`GXReadPixMetric`) count samples that pass (a GL occlusion query) plus 4 per triangle, which the pollution counters subtract again; copy passes are not counted.
- **GPU reads arrive one frame late.**
  A synchronous read makes the CPU wait until the GPU has drawn everything queued, so the two stop overlapping (the plaza made 30–85 such reads a frame).
  As in Dolphin, the reads the game repeats every frame are answered from the same read one frame earlier: copy write-backs are stored a frame later (a pixel buffer and a fence), a pixel-metric pair is answered from the previous frame's query when it drew the same number of triangles, and each group of `GXPeekARGB`/`GXPeekZ` calls with no drawing in between is answered from the previous frame's 1× snapshot of the EFB.
  A read with no previous frame to use is still synchronous.
  Rendering is unchanged, but the game sees the goop map and pollution counts a frame later, so scripted runs can drift slightly from the synchronous ones.
  `SMS_GX_SYNC_READS=1` goes back to synchronous reads.
- **Textures written by the CPU as 16-bit words** in host byte order would decode with swapped bytes.
  Formats made of bytes (I4, I8, IA4, C8, RGBA8) are unaffected.
- **Pixel formats.**
  `RGB565_Z16` (AA) is treated like RGB8; RGBA6 is not quantized to 6 bits.
- **Other hardware features** are not emulated: TMEM preloading, the vertex cache, bounding boxes, performance counters, the scissor box offset, and the texture LOD differences between GX and GL.
